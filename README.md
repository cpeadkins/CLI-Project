# Project Description
This purpose of this academic project is to practice Ruby API utilization and user input via Command Line Interface. The application queries the user for a date input (format YYYY-MM-DD with guidance) and will output an index from NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API. When presented with an invalid date input, the program should notify the user.
For reference the full index can be found here: https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepixFull.html
